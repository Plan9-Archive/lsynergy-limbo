# status

can be used.  problem is writes to /dev/mouse (like acme does) to
move the mouse.  the synergy server won't know the mouse has moved,
so has a wrong idea about the local mouse.


# about

this is code for a synergy client.  protocol message packing/unpacking
is in a library.

what it can do:

- connect to a synergy server
- write mousemovements to /dev/mousein to update mouse location
- write keyboard characters to /dev/kbin to emulate typing characters.
  converted from xorg's key codes (which are a bit like scancode set 1).


# install

make sure you have $ROOT set, now "mk install" to compile and install
the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
