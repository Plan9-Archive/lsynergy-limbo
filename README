# status

can be used.  problem is writes to /dev/mouse (like acme does) to
move the mouse.  the synergy server won't know the mouse has moved,
so has a wrong idea about the local mouse.


# about

this is code for a synergy client.  protocol message packing/unpacking
is in a library.

what it can do:

- connect to a synergy server
- write mousemovements to /dev/mousein to update mouse location
- write keyboard characters to /dev/kbin to emulate typing characters.
  converted from xorg's key codes (which are a bit like scancode set 1).


# install

to install, first make a file "mkconfig" similar to your inferno's
installation mkconfig (symlink/bind it).  now type "mk install" to
compile and install.  NOTE: just "mk" does not work, since the
module files (*.m) will be missing and compilation of source files
(*.b) will fail.


# example

(on plan 9)

bind -a '#Î™' /dev
emu -c0
bind -a '#U*/dev' /dev  # get kbin & mousein
synerc -dd -a net!$synergyserver!24800 $screenwidth $screenheight

# todo

- some xorg key codes are not properly converted, e.g. pgdn, arrows, some of ins/del/home/end, etc.
- fix problem with synergy server/client having different idea of mouse
