this is code for a synergy client.  perhaps a server in the future
too.  besides a library to read/write synergy protocol messages,
only a client has been implemented, and only partially.

what it can do:
- connect to a synergy server
- write mousemovements to /dev/pointer to update mouse location
- write keyboard characters to /dev/keyboard to emulate typing characters.  no conversion is being done.

what is left to implement:
- convert the keyboard codes that come from the server to something a /dev/keyboard reader understands.  handle shift/control/alt/other special keys.
- provide a new /dev/pointer that also sends clicks
- find out whether we need to keep writing to original /dev/pointer to update our location.  perhaps only at startup, probably not though.
- perhaps provide a /dev/keyboard as well, that would mean the usual keyboard on the machine can not be used, so doesn't make make sense.
